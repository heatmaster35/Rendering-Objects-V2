The objects that work with my code are
fireplace.coor/.poly
and cube.coor/.poly.
some of the files give errors, but these should work.
also, it rotates by the x and y axis(i didn't realize we
where only suppose to do one of the axis, sorry).

also the toggle button is different based on color:
green button = ortho
red button = perspective
